# InnerLoop: AI Architecture with Autonomous Initiative

> The first AI system designed to think continuously and take genuine initiative, not just respond to prompts.

InnerLoop implements a tri-agent architecture that gives AI systems the ability to generate autonomous thoughts, make proactive decisions, and maintain continuous cognitive processing - addressing the fundamental limitation of current LLMs that only "think" when prompted.

## 🧠 Core Concept

Current LLMs are purely reactive - they only activate when given input. InnerLoop creates an autonomous cognitive loop where AI agents can:

- Generate spontaneous thoughts and ideas
- Take initiative in conversations and decision-making  
- Maintain continuous background processing
- Develop genuine preferences and autonomous behaviors

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

InnerLoop consists of three specialized agents working in coordination:

### 1. The Experiencer Agent
- **Role**: Primary consciousness/decision-maker
- **Function**: Processes information, makes final decisions, handles external interactions
- **Analogy**: The "conscious mind" that experiences and decides

### 2. The Stream Generator  
- **Role**: Autonomous thought generator
- **Function**: Continuously produces background thoughts, associations, memories, and ideas
- **Analogy**: The stream of consciousness/background mental chatter

### 3. The Attention Director
- **Role**: Cognitive filter and priority manager
- **Function**: Decides what deserves the Experiencer's attention (external input vs internal thoughts)
- **Analogy**: Executive attention/cognitive control system

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Python 3.12** (avoiding 3.13 compatibility issues)
- **Ollama** for local LLM inference
- **ChromaDB** (in-memory) for semantic memory search
- **SQLite** for conversation logging
- **Textual** for terminal UI (coming soon)
- **asyncio** for concurrent agent execution

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed and running
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- Compatible LLM model downloaded via Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama and download a model
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama pull gemma3:27b-it-qat
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wearewebera/innerloop.git
cd innerloop

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve  # In another terminal if not already running

# Optional: Set Ollama host if not using default localhost:11434
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://your-ollama-server:11434

# Run the system
# Default: Multi-panel TUI (recommended for full visibility)
python main.py

# Option: Simple CLI interface
python main.py --ui cli

# Custom configuration file
python main.py --config custom_config.yaml

# View all options
python main.py --help
```

```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `config.yaml` file controls all aspects of the system:

```yaml
model:
  name: "gemma3:27b-it-qat"   # Ollama model to use
  temperature: 0.7            # Response creativity (0-1)
  max_tokens: 512             # Max response length

agents:
  shared_identity:            # Common identity for all agents
    name: "Alex"
    personality: "curious, analytical, thoughtful"
    
  stream_generator:
    thoughts_per_minute: 3    # Autonomous thought frequency
    
  attention_director:
    priority_threshold: 0.3   # Min score to pass thoughts
    attention_budget: 5       # Max items per cycle

memory:
  chromadb:
    collection_name: "innerloop_memories"
  sqlite:
    db_path: "conversation_history.db"
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Continuous Processing**: All three agents run concurrently in async loops

2. **Thought Generation**: Stream Generator produces thoughts every ~20 seconds:
   - Associations with recent topics
   - Memory recalls
   - Wonderings and reflections
   - Occasional insights

3. **Attention Management**: Attention Director evaluates each thought for:
   - Relevance to current context
   - Urgency and importance
   - Novelty compared to recent thoughts
   - Emotional significance

4. **Conscious Processing**: Experiencer integrates high-priority thoughts and:
   - Responds to user input
   - Makes decisions
   - Updates memory
   - Maintains conversation flow

5. **Memory Integration**: 
   - ChromaDB stores and retrieves semantic memories
   - SQLite logs all conversations and agent interactions
   - Agents reference past experiences autonomously

## 🧪 Observing Autonomous Behavior

When running InnerLoop, watch for these emergent behaviors:

- **Spontaneous Comments**: Alex might suddenly share a thought or memory
- **Topic Connections**: Drawing unexpected links between concepts
- **Self-Reflection**: Comments about its own thinking process
- **Memory Integration**: References to earlier conversations
- **Initiative Taking**: Asking questions or suggesting new topics

### 💭 Continuous Thought Display

InnerLoop offers two interfaces:

#### Simple CLI Mode (`python main.py --ui cli`)
Shows filtered thoughts inline with conversation:
```
[🔗 Association (0.65)]: This reminds me of neural networks...
[💡 Insight (0.82)]: Understanding emerges from simple rules!

You: What interests you most about AI?

[🤔 Wonder (0.45)]: I wonder how memories shape perception...
[💭 Memory (0.71)]: I remember discussing consciousness before...

Alex: I find myself constantly drawn to questions about consciousness...
```

#### Multi-Panel TUI Mode (`python main.py`) - Default & Recommended
Shows ALL agent activity in real-time across four panels:
