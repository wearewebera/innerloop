# Contributing to InnerLoop

We welcome contributions! InnerLoop is an exploration into autonomous AI consciousness and we're excited to build this future together.

## Key Areas for Contribution

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Refine agent prompts for better autonomy
2. **Memory System**: Implement memory consolidation and forgetting
3. **UI/UX**: Enhance the Textual TUI interface
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Expand usage examples and guides
6. **Tool Development**: Create new tools for agent capabilities
7. **Performance**: Optimize agent processing and memory usage

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (when available)
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

See the [Technical Details](technical-details.md) for installation instructions.

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Testing

Currently, testing is minimal but we're working on comprehensive test coverage. When adding new features:

- Consider edge cases
- Test with different model configurations
- Verify async operations work correctly
- Check memory usage and performance
