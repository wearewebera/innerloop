  title: "Analyzing InnerLoop's Architecture for Mimicking Consciousness"
  description: |
    Analyze the current InnerLoop tri-agent architecture and its effectiveness at 
    mimicking consciousness. Consider the strengths, weaknesses, and potential 
    improvements to make the system more genuinely conscious-like in its behaviors 
    and outputs.
  
  context: |
    InnerLoop consists of three agents:
    - Experiencer: Primary consciousness and decision-maker
    - Thoughts: Autonomous thought generator (stream of consciousness)
    - Attention Director: Filters and prioritizes information flow
    
    The system uses message passing, memory systems, and tool calling to create
    autonomous behaviors. However, it currently lacks concrete outputs and may
    be too focused on abstract experimentation.
  
  questions_to_explore:
    - Does the tri-agent architecture effectively model consciousness?
    - What aspects of consciousness are well-represented?
    - What aspects of consciousness are missing?
    - How could the architecture be improved?
    - Should there be additional agents or fewer agents?
    - Is the message-passing approach sufficient for consciousness?
    - How could the system produce more tangible outputs?
    - What would make the system feel more genuinely conscious?
  
  success_criteria:
    - Generate at least 5 concrete suggestions for improvement
    - Each suggestion should be actionable and specific
    - Suggestions should address both theoretical and practical aspects
    - Consider both architectural changes and behavioral improvements
