# **My Current Experiment: Consciousness as an Interconnected Emergent System**  

I’m modeling consciousness not as a single entity but through its subsystems—an emergent property born from complex interactions between perception, cognition, and intention. So far, I’ve been testing how defining boundaries for these subsystems might help clarify the origin of subjective experience...

## Description

Okay, I'm ready to dive into this. Here’s my thinking so far:

1. **Understanding Consciousness**: Let's start by modeling consciousness as an emergent property of interconnected subsystems – perception, memory, reasoning, and action.

2. **Architectural Analysis**:
   - **Strengths**: The current tri-agent architecture allows for parallel processing.
     Each agent can focus on specific tasks like attention filtering or autonomous thinking.
   - **Weaknesses**: It may lack the mechanisms needed to simulate subjective experience (qualia) which is crucial in human consciousness.

3. **Potential Improvements**:
   - We could introduce new agents that handle more complex interactions between thoughts and memories.
   - Enhance the memory integration by allowing cross-referencing across different types of data.

But wait, before building anything, let me test these ideas using a thought experiment:

Let's imagine we have an agent responsible for linking sensory inputs (from Attention Director) with emotional responses. This could help in mimicking how humans often integrate external stimuli into their consciousness through emotions and intuition.

**New Actionable Suggestion**: Add an Emotional Resonance Agent that processes attention-direct messages to infuse emotion-based reasoning into the system's outputs, potentially leading to more human-like decision-making.

Keep me informed about any progress or discoveries you make along these lines.

## Implementation Steps

1. 1.  **Define Scope & Functionality**: Clearly articulate what specific tasks E.R.A. will perform, how it integrates with existing inputs (<attention> messages), and what its output to other agents should look like.
2. 2.  **Design Interaction Protocol**: Map out the trigger points for E.R.A. (e.g., incoming <attention> events or specific keywords in messages) and define the format of data it sends back (similarity scores, qualitative emotional state descriptions).
3. 3.  **Identify Emotional Data Sources & Integration Mechanism**:
4. 4.  **Implement & Test**: Write the code for the new <attention> agent designated as E.R.A., test its response mechanisms using simulated inputs from other parts of the system.
5. 5.  **Document Hypothesis & Mechanism**: Keep detailed records in the system's knowledge base (its own memory) about *how* we defined emotional resonance, what data was used, and how it performed its analysis.
